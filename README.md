# VersionOne SDK.NET ObjectModel
Copyright (c) 2008-2012 VersionOne, Inc.
All rights reserved.

The ObjectModel library provide a strongly-typed model on top of the VersionOne SDK.NET API Client library. This allows developers to easily and quickly develop VersionOne integrations and complementary applications/utilities using domain objects (Project, Story, Iteration, etc) instead of more abstract objects (Asset, Attribute). The ObjectModel is suitable for fine-grained access, such as creating new VersionOne assets.

This product includes software developed at VersionOne (http://versionone.com/). This product is open source and is licensed under a modified BSD license, which reflects our intent that software built with a dependency on the  VersionOne SDK.NET can be commercial or open source, as the authors see fit.
