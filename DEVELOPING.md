# Developing with VersionOne SDK.NET #

## Getting Libraries ##
VersionOne SDK.NET consists of two DLLs:

* VersionOne.SDK.APIClient
* VersionOne.SDK.ObjectModel

Both libraries are available via:

* NuGet from within Visual Studio.
* Download binares in a zip file.

### APIClient ###
The APIClient provides access to the Core API without concern for the 
underlying RESTful API or the HTTP/XML plumbing. Through the APIClient, 
developers can query for simple or complex sets of information, update the 
information, and execute system-defined operations. The APIClient is best 
suited for course-grained and bulk access.

### ObjectModel ###
The ObjectModel libraries provide a strongly-typed model on top of APIClient. 
This allows developers to easily and quickly develop VersionOne integrations 
and complementary applications/utilities using domain objects (Project, Story, 
Iteration, etc) instead of more abstract objects (Asset, Attribute). The 
ObjectModel is suitable for fine-grained access, such as creating new 
VersionOne assets.


## Building from Source ##
The solution uses NuGet to resolve external dependencies. Since the test 
projects depend on NUnit, NuGet will install the correct version of NUnit when 
Visual Studio builds the test projects.

## Testing ##
Different testing strategies have been employed for each layer of 
VersionOne SDK.NET.

### APIClient ###
VersionOne.SDK.APIClient.Tests run without a VersionOne installation. In order 
to ease execution of the unit tests, the project file has a reference to:
`$(SolutionDir)\packages\NUnit.Runners.<version>\tools\nunit.exe`

1. Build the VersionOne.SDK.APIClient.Tests project.
2. Right-click on the VersionOne.SDK.APIClient.Tests project and select 
   `Debug > Start new instance` or `Debug > Step Into new instance`.

By default Visual Studio's debugger will not stop on breakpoints when executing 
the tests in the external NUnit tool. To enable breakpoints, modify the 
`packages\NUnit.Runners.<verion>\tools\nunit.exe.config` file under 
`Startup > supportedRuntime` as follows:

```xml
  <startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true">
    <!-- Comment out the next line to force use of .NET 4.0 -->
    <!-- <supportedRuntime version="v2.0.50727" /> -->
    <supportedRuntime version="v4.0.30319" />
  </startup>
```

This forces the NUnit runner to execute under .NET 4.0, and allows Visual 
Studio to thus load the debug symbols. Otherwise, NUnit executes under 2.0, but 
spawns a separate process to execute the tests under version 4.0.

### ObjectModel ###
VersionOne.SDK.ObjectModel.Tests require a VersionOne instance. The 
`InstallV1.cmd` script installs the VersionOne application with options 
necessary for testing. It requires some modifications for local environments.

#### Database Restore ####
By default, the script will restore the database backup to the default SQL 
Server intance on the local machine. To override the defaults:

* Change the `RESTORE_DB` variable to `false`.
* Change the `DB_SERVER` to the DB server and instance. 
  Example: `(local)\SQL2008` or `dbserver\MyInstance`
* Copy the `V1SDKTests.exe` file to the target server if it is not the local 
  machine. Run `V1SDKTests.exe` to extract the `V1SDKTests.bak` file. It should 
  end up about 15 megabytes.
* Edit the `RestoreV1SDKTestsDB.sql` file to configure the paths needed to 
  restoree DB from disk on the target SQL Server instance. 

*Note:* The DB name `V1SDKTests` is hard-coded into other files; hence, the DB 
name should not be changed.

#### Application Installer ####

* Copy the VersionOne installer exe file into the TestSetup directory.
* Edit `InstallV1.cmd` and modify the `V1_SETUP` variable to point to the name 
  of the installer. By default it is `VersionOne.Setup-Ultimate-latest.exe`.
* Type `InstallV1.cmd` from the command line.

*Note:* A SQL script attempts to determine the exact location for the DB files. 
If it fails, replace the `CALL SET_SQL_VARS.bat` with 
`SET SQL_DATA_DIR=<Path to SQL DataDir>`. Example: 
`C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10_50.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\`

After the `InstallV1.cmd` script completes, the success message should read:

```
Thank you, you can browse to http://localhost/V1SDKTests and login with 
admin / admin, and you should be able to execute the integration tests now...
```

*Note:* Run `UnInstallV1.cmd` to uninstall the VersionOne application and 
database.

#### Running the Tests ####
In order to ease execution of the unit tests, the 
VersionOne.SDK.ObjectModel.Tests project file has a reference to:
`$(SolutionDir)\packages\NUnit.Runners.<version>\tools\nunit.exe`

1. Build the VersionOne.SDK.ObjectModel.Tests project.
2. Right-click on the VersionOne.SDK.ObjectModel.Tests project and select 
   `Debug > Start new instance` or `Debug > Step Into new instance`.

By default Visual Studio's debugger will not stop on breakpoints when executing 
the tests in the external NUnit tool. To enable breakpoints, modify the 
`packages\NUnit.Runners.<verion>\tools\nunit.exe.config` file under 
`Startup > supportedRuntime` as follows:

```xml
  <startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true">
    <!-- Comment out the next line to force use of .NET 4.0 -->
    <!-- <supportedRuntime version="v2.0.50727" /> -->
    <supportedRuntime version="v4.0.30319" />
  </startup>
```

This forces the NUnit runner to execute under .NET 4.0, and allows Visual 
Studio to thus load the debug symbols. Otherwise, NUnit executes under 2.0, but 
spawns a separate process to execute the tests under version 4.0.
